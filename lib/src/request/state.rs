/// Request guard to retrieve managed state.
///
/// This type can be used as a request guard to retrieve the state Rocket is
/// managing for some type `T`. This allows for the sharing of state across any
/// number of handlers. A value for the given type must previously have been
/// registered to be managed by Rocket via the
/// [manage](/rocket/struct.Rocket.html#method.manage) method. The type being
/// managed must be thread safe and sendable across thread boundaries. In other
/// words, it must implement `Send + Sync + 'static`.
///
/// # Example
///
/// Imagine you have some configuration struct of the type `MyConfig` that you'd
/// like to initialize at start-up and later access it in several handlers. The
/// following example does just this:
///
/// ```rust
/// # #![feature(plugin)]
/// # #![plugin(rocket_codegen)]
/// # extern crate rocket;
/// use rocket::State;
///
/// // In a real application, this would likely be more complex.
/// struct MyConfig(String);
///
/// #[get("/")]
/// fn index(state: State<MyConfig>) -> String {
///     format!("The config value is: {}", state.0)
/// }
///
/// #[get("/raw")]
/// fn raw_config_value<'r>(state: State<'r, MyConfig>) -> &'r str {
///     // use `inner()` to get a lifetime longer than `deref` gives us
///     state.inner().0.as_str()
/// }
///
/// fn main() {
///     let config = MyConfig("user input".to_string());
/// # if false { // We don't actually want to launch the server in an example.
///     rocket::ignite()
///         .mount("/", routes![index, raw_config_value])
///         .manage(config)
///         .launch();
/// # }
/// }
/// ```
